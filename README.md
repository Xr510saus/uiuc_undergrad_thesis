# uiuc_undergrad_thesis

## Project description

For my undergraduate (UIUC) thesis, I designed a cable-driven soft robot to crawl on 2D surfaces. This repo contains the entire history of the project, which lasted over my final two semesters at UIUC, starting from my funding application, through my progress reports, and finally ending at the FINAL DELIVERABLES directory, which contains my actual thesis and the slides I presented at the Undergraduate Thesis Symposium.
