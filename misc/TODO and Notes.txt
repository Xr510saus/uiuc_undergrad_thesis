TODO:
* Design layout for soft body
	* Required components:
		* Two flippers (maybe 3)
		* Two servos (maybe 3)
		* 1 Buck booster
		* 1 dev board
		* 1 battery
		* Wires (negligible)
	* Considerations:
		* IMPORTANT: how to constrain flippers on the soft body?
		* Waterproof? If so, how to design a sealed area for the electronics
			* Would be able to do this ideally, so that the environment is flexible and opens up more potential applications
		* If improving edges does not work, third servo and flipper to push up the body and reduce friction in one direction? Or actuating mass to change friction\
		* Potentially easy way to remove/charge battery
		* The use of a printed board
			* Keeps components in place, can put circles and use "pegs" on the soft body to constrain the electronics

* Add another signal to control the second servo independently
* Print another cap and fix onto the servos



Notes:
* Each mold roughly 30 g for Dragon Skin 30

NOTES FOR THESIS:
* hysteresis-based control (non-linear control)
* wanted to create untethered testbed for said control type
* inspiration from turtle, which can use its flippers to move on land, reset, and repeat
