Purpose of swarm robotics:
* Validate collective control algorithms irl, not just through simulation

What other groups have done:
* Tested out on 10s, 100s of robots
* Limited by robot cost and operational complexity
	* Turning robots on/off, charging, controlling, and programming

Main point:
* All operations of the robot must work on the collective as a whole and be scalable

Kilobot:
* $14 worth of parts
* 5 min assembly
* Features
	* Differential drive locomotion
	* On-board computation power
	* Neighbor-to-neighbor communication
	* Neighbor-to-neighbor distance sensing
